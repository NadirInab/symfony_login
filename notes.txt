Today, I wreated a simple Rest Api with the help of :
- FOSRestBundle which is  Symfony bundle that provides additional functionality and tools for building RESTful APIs .
- Created a user entity (name, email,age ,password) => made migrations .
- The user is :
    - Created => POST
    - Fetched => GET
    - Updated => PUT
    - Deleted => DELETE 

Api testing with postman .
